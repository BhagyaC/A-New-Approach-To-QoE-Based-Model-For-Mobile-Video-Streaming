Delivery of video through Internet was introduced in
1990âĂŹs itself. It evolved from method to method be-
cause of the increase in the Internet bandwidth and the
growth of world wide web [2]. The timely delivery of data
was the great issue ever. The evolution starts with the
Real-Time transfer protocol (RTP) proposed by Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and it worked well in man-
aged IP Networks. After that, the managed IP networks
are replaced by Content Delivery Network (CDN) and
it introduced a conflict in using RTP. Hence a need for
another server to control this RTP introduced.
The introduction of HTTP streaming was one that can
use the advantage of high internet bandwidth. HTTP
streaming provides transfer of large packets instead of
small chunks. And it can manage by CDN by standard op-
timization techniques and it is firewall friendly in contrast
with RTP. Becuase of these advantages HTTP stream-
ing became popular in commercial implementations. Ap-
pleâĂŹs HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) [3], MicrosoftâĂŹs
Smooth Streaming [3], and AdobeâĂŹs HTTP Dynamic
Streaming [4] all use HTTP streaming as their underlying
method of delivery. But each of these implementations
has it’s on manifest and segment formats. All we need
is nothing but a standardization which a standards-based
client to stream content from any standards-based server,
and it provides a interoperability between different servers
of different vendors. As a result new standard intro-
duced known as MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), is currently at the Draft
International Standard stage. DASH is designed to be
codec-agnostic, but the specification recommends the use
of MPEG-4 files or MPEG-2 streams [6]. DASH adaptive
streaming is nothing but the audio as well as video con-
tents are split into different bit-rate chunks according to
the current network bandwidth the adaptive algorithm will
select the best audio and video chunk and serves to the
client. More advanced uses cases may include switching
between multiple camera views, 3-D multimedia content
streaming, video streams with subtitles and captions, dy-
namic ad-insertion, low latency live streaming, playback
of mixed streaming and pre-stored content, and others[2].
The MPEG-DASH specification is a feature-rich standard
with many additional features.

Even though we have a good adaptive streaming
methodology the success of the system comes when it
has a good Quality of experience (QoE).Over the last
decade, the performance was measured and monitored
using a method called Quality of service (QoS), which
is a mechanism of assessment in the network. According# A-New-Approach-To-QoE-Based-Model-For-Mobile-Video-Streaming

Delivery of video through Internet was introduced in 1990s itself.
It evolved from method to method be-cause of the increase in the Internet bandwidth and the

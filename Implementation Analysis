A. Implementation Details
While implimenting the model also there are two phases,
first phase for mutlinominal regression part where the
dependency between objective and subjective parameters
are found second phase the dependent parameters are
considered for modeling and the user expectation is pre-
dicted.For implimentation for the time being considering
the the M=5, thet is the there are 5 objective matrices
considering in this model, Namely (i)Startup delay re-
ward (ii)Interruption Ratio (iii)Average Bitrate Efficiency
(iv)Video Continuity Index (v)Bitrate Switching reward.
And N=4,That is there are 4 subjective parameters areFig. 7.

considering in this model.Hence the condition N<=M
satisfied. The all subjective parameters are related to some
objective parameters , But theb dependency between the
objective parameter and the subjective parameters must
be considered in the further part of the QoE modeling
becuase the parameters are considered as independent is
the one of the limitation faces by the QoE modeling.
The subjective parameters are collected from a set of
users. The subjective analysis is done like rating the video
for the selected 4 parameter on a scale of 1 to 5. Hence
for the 4 parameter there will be a table like for each
expectation how many fraction of support is there. The
table explains the same for the parameter Startup delay
Reward.
Using these data the depndency between the objective
and subjective parameters have to be found. In multino-
mial regression the dependency is found out with respect
to a reference variable called reference event. Here the
reference event user expectation (α).
α = (7.9*1+7.5*2+22.2*3+45.8*4+16.5*6)/100
= 3.5
Taking the reference event as the upper ceiling of the
value obtained. So the α 0 =d3.5e = 4.
Hence the table will feed to the multinomial regression
and the intercept and coefficient of the fraction of support
will be obtained as in table (Fig.8)
Using these intercepts and coefficients the model can
predict the probability of each expectation with respect
to the reference level. But here there is a need of error
correction in multinomial regression. Becuase during the
selection of reference event the ceiling of alpha obtained is
selected. So there is a chance of error and that have to be
optimized.
User Expectation (α) = dαe=Rounded User Expecta-
tion or α'
Hence the equation that explained above will be modified
The predicted values for each expectation after error
optimization is described in the table. After the expec-
tation value prediction the the test data will pass in to
the chi-square analysis.The null hypothesis for the chi-
square analysis is defined as H0: The objective parameters
are dependent on subjective parameters, The significant
level for Model is selected as 0.05 or 5%. This model has
a likelihood ratio ÏĞ 2 of 3.6389 with a p-value greater
than .05 and 4 degrees of freedom, which indicates that
the model as a whole fits significantly better with the
user expectation as a predictor. (The ÏĞ 2 statistic is the
difference in 2 log-likelihoods between the final model and
a reduced model. The reduced model is formed by omitting
an effect from the final model [11].) In another words the
null hypothesis accepted.
After finalizing that the objective parameters and the
subjective parameters are dependent to each other the
4 dependent parameters and the 1 objective parameter
passed to the next phase called modeling phase.The mod-
eling part is nothing but a GLZ with a logit function as
a link function. The GLZ model considers the cumulative
distributive function other than a probability distributive
function . ategory CDF is denoted by u = P (Y âĽďi)
with a condition |x1, ..., xl.So here it is like P (Y <=
Ci|SDR, IR, ABE, V CI, BSR) for convinience it is repre-
sented as P (Y <= Ci|x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) and for simplicity
the equation reduced to
u = P (Y <= i) Its highly non linear and transform it
into linear one use the logit fuction
f (u) = log(u/1 − u).The result of GLZ will be
f (P (Y <= i))= β0+β1x1+β2x2+β3x3+β4x4+β5x5
and considering the trivial condition the predicted value
will be
exp(β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + β4x4 + β5x5)
P (Y <= i) =
1 + exp(β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + β4x4 + β5x5
The table contains the coeffients obtained for GLZ
model and these data canbe used to analyse which pa-
rameter is influencing the model the most.The final part
of the model is nothing but calculating the BIC so that to
understand how much this model fits to the data.BIC = âĹŠ2 ln(L) + k ln(N ) ,the less BIC value
means it is a best fit to the data. The real need of these
evaluation comes only when a new parameter introduced
to the model and the prediction equation become more
bigger. THere this value gave a better understanding
of influence of OQoE
